# BBEdit Recovery

So over the last few years as a developer I've experienced three instances of a [MacBook swollen battery](https://www.consumerreports.org/laptop-computers/some-macbook-pro-batteries-can-swell-what-you-need-to-know/). I do not know if I'm just scripting too much in BBEdit with AppleScript or too many `npx` calls for React. Either way I've found over time I was manually copying over my BBEdit settings and thought there has got to be a better way to backup when it happened again last month.
